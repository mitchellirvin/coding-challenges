/*
the constructor takes a quotaâ€”the number of items that will be produced/consumed
    before terminating
each instance has a unique_id
has a toString() which returns a String of the form
    "Producerunique_id" or "Consumerunique_id"

run in a cycle until the quota has been reached
    produce an item and insert() it
    or
    remove() an item and consume it [consumption will do nothing]

before terminating
    print total number of items produced/consumed
        "Producerunique_id FINISHED producing quota items"
        or
        "Consumerunique_id FINISHED consuming quota items"
