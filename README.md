# coding-challenges
A playground for coding. The goal of this adventure is to develop in depth knowledge of various data structures and algorithms, while also broadening and refining general problem solving skills.

Many of the challenges come from [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/),
some others from [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/),
and still more from technical screenings.
