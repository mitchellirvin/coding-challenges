# coding-challenges
A playground for coding, algorithm design, and the study of data structures and their relationships. The goal of this adventure is to develop in depth knowledge of various data structures,  algorithms, and programming concepts, while also broadening and refining general problem solving skills.

Many of the challenges come from [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/),
some others from [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/).
